## Transportation

Downtown Palo Alto and Stanford's Campus are about 1 mile apart and connected by Palm Drive. You can either walk or take the [FREE Marguerite Shuttle](https://transportation.stanford.edu/getting-stanford/marguerite/shuttle-lines-and-schedules){:target="\_blank"}.

The Marguerite's [P Shuttle](https://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite/p){:target="\_blank"} runs between the Palo Alto Caltrain Station (adjacent to the parking lot, on the circle) to the Stanford University Bus Stop ([Google Maps Link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fqmoPHPCxStAVGG38){:target="\_blank"}), at the top of the Palm Drive Oval.
